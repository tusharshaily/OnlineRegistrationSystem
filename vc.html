    Since its founding, Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology (MMMUT) Gorakhpur has grown to become National flagship, research-led university, known for the excellence of its teaching, its research, and its service to local, national and international communities. Our prime motive here is not only to develop technocrats and managers but also professionals with human values who make noteworthy contributions to the society and our nation.<br><br>
MMMUT has been strategically built (2013) on the legacy of success presented by MMM Engineering College Gorakhpur in providing quality education. Banking on our experience, we have single-mindedly committed ourselves to innovatively design course curriculum vetted by industry experts, who possess practical know-how, and applied with complete dedication to achieve academic excellence. Research plays a vital role in any University. Faculties with the same vision will be there for you at every step of your journey. Research and consultancy will be incentivized.  <br><br>
We have more than 2800 students of whom 2208 are undergraduate students in six B. Tech. programmes in Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering, Computer Science &amp; Engineering and Chemical Engineering along with M.B.A., M.C.A.  University is running M. Tech. in 12 disciplines and full time Ph.D. programme in number of disciplines as part of Quality Improvement Programme of MHRD and TEQIP-II project. <br><br>
Our Vision is to make MMM University of Technology a name to reckon with in the academic fraternity by giving a strong impetus to creating an environment of knowledge application and holistically inspiring students to become eminent leaders of tomorrow. The quality benchmarks are applicable to our faculty selection, infrastructure and systems that are set to manage the organization. We are prepared to accept new challenges and make our University a world-class educational centre of knowledge generation, acquisition and dissemination.<br><br>
Our challenge is to help to generate ideas that will benefit society, and to educate and train people to work in fields where they will be valued both for their specialised knowledge, and for their ability to research, communicate and solve problems. To meet these challenges we need to build on the alliances and collaborative partnerships the University has established with business, government, and other research institutions.<br><br>
We look forward to welcoming you to the MMM University of Technology Gorakhpur.
